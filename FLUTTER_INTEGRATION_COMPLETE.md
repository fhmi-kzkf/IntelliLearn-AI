### Implementation Approach for Flutter

The Flutter integration can be implemented using:

1. **HTTP Client**: `http` or `dio` package
2. **State Management**: Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc pattern
3. **Secure Storage**: `flutter_secure_storage` for token management
4. **Navigation**: Standard Flutter navigation or go_router

### Sample Flutter Integration Code

Key integration patterns are provided in [FLUTTER_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](FLUTTER_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md), including:

```dart
// Authentication
Future<Map<String, dynamic>?> login(String username, String password)

// Making authenticated requests
Future<http.Response> _makeAuthenticatedRequest(String url)

// Course data retrieval
Future<List<dynamic>?> getAvailableCourses()

// Quiz interaction
Future<Map<String, dynamic>?> startQuiz(int quizId)
```

## API Endpoint Summary

### Authentication
- `POST /api/accounts/api/login/` - User login
